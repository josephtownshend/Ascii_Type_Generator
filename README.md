# Ascii Type Generator 1.0

This readme serves as documentation of a small project to build a command line ASCII Type Generator using Ruby.

## First steps
* ~get the app to successfully return an ASCII 'A' - formatted correctly with testing.~
* create an array storing all the letters.
* break letters down into strips that can be combined to create the letters in the method dynamically.
